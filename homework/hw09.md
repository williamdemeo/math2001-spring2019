\medskip

1. Write the principle of complete induction using the notation of symbolic logic. Also write the least element principle this way, and use logical manipulations to show that the two are equivalent.

   \medskip

2. Show that for every $n$, $0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots n^2= \frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)$.

    <!-- 3. Show that for every $n$, $0^3 + 1^3 + \ldots + n^3 = \frac{1}{4} n^2 (n+1)^2$. -->

   \medskip

3. Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers, $F_0 = 1$,  $F_1 = 1$, and $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n\geq 2$.

    Prove Cassini's identity: for every $n\geq 0$, $F^2_{n+1} - F_{n+2} F_n = (-1)^n$. 

    Hint: in the induction step, write $F_{n+2}^2$ as $F_{n+2}(F_{n+1} + F_n)$.

   \medskip

   <!-- 4. Prove $\sum_{i < n} F_{2i+1} = F_{2n}$. -->

   <!-- 5. Prove the following two identities:

   + $F_{2n+1} = F^2_{n+1} + F^2_n$
   + $F_{2n+2} = F^2_{n+2} - F^2_n$

   Hint: use induction on $n$, and prove them both at once. In the induction step, expand $F_{2n+3} = F_{2n+2} + F_{2n+1}$, and similarly for $F_{2n+4}$. Proving the second equation is especially tricky. Use the inductive hypothesis and the first identity to simplify the left-hand side, and repeatedly unfold the Fibonacci number with the highest index and simplify the equation you need to prove. (When you have worked out a solution, write a clear equational proof, calculating in the \$\$forward'' direction.) -->

   \medskip

4. Prove that every natural number can be written as a sum of *distinct* powers of 2. For this problem, $1 = 2^0$ is counted as power of 2.

   \medskip

5. Let $V$ be a non-empty set of integers such that the following two properties hold:

    + If $x, y \in V$, then $x - y \in V$.
    + If $x \in V$, then every multiple of $x$ is an element of $V$.

    Prove that there is some $d \in V$, such that $V$ is equal to the set of multiples of $d$. Hint: use the least element principle.

    <!-- 9. Give an informal but detailed proof that for every natural number $n$, $1 \cdot n = n$, using a proof by induction, the definition of multiplication, and the theorems proved in :numref:$defining_arithmetic_operations$. -->

    \medskip

6. Show that multiplication distributes over addition. In other words, prove that for natural numbers $m$, $n$, and $k$, $m (n + k) = m n + m k$. Use the definitions of addition and multiplication and facts proved in 17.4 (but nothing more).

   \medskip

7. Prove the multiplication is associative, in the same way. Use the facts proved in 17.4 and the previous exercise.

   \medskip

8. Prove that multiplication is commutative.

   <!-- 13. Prove $(m^n)^k = m^{nk}$.   

   14. Following the example in :numref:$arithmetic_on_the_natural_numbers$, prove that if $n$ is a natural number and $n < 5$, then $n$ is one of the values $0, 1, 2, 3$, or $4$.
   -->

   \medskip

9. Prove that if $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers and $n m = 1$, then $n = m = 1$, using only properties listed in 17.5.

    This is tricky. First show that $n$ and $m$ are greater than $0$, and hence greater than or equal to $1$. Then show that if either one of them is greater than $1$, then $n m > 1$.

<!-- 16. Prove any of the other claims in :numref:$arithmetic_on_the_natural_numbers$ that were stated without proof.

17. Prove the following properties of negation and subtraction on the integers, using only the properties of negation and subtraction given in :numref:$the_integers$.

   -  If $n + m = 0$ then $m = -n$.
   -  $-0 = 0$.
   -  If $-n = -m$ then $n = m$.
   -  $m + (n - m) = n$.
   -  $-(n + m) = -n - m$.
   -  If $m < n$ then $n - m > 0$.
   -  If $m < n$ then $-m > -n$.
   -  $n \cdot (-m) = -nm$.
   -  $n(m - k) = nm - nk$.
   -  If $n < m$ then $n - k < m - k$.
-->

**Extra Credit Exercise** 

Suppose you have an infinite chessboard with a natural number written in each square. The value in each square is the average of the values of the four neighboring squares. Prove that all the values on the chessboard are equal.
<!-- 
19. Prove that every natural number can be written as a sum of *distinct non-consecutive* Fibonacci numbers. For example, $22 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 13$ is not allowed, since 3 and 5 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, but $22 = 1 + 21$ is allowed. -->
