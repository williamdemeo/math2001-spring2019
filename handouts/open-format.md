## Policy on Electronic Document Submissions

**Updated:** 2013.01.28

I do not accept electronic documents that use proprietary formats, such as
those created using Microsoft Office or Apple iWork.

A few of the many open (non-proprietary) formats that I do accept are: plain
ascii text, markdown, html, pdf, djvu, dvi, ps, png, jpeg, and LaTeX.
Please visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format to see a more
complete list of open formats, all of which I accept.

Distributing documents in proprietary formats, like Microsoft's .docx,
is bad for you and for others. You can't be sure what these documents
will look like if someone views them with a different version of Word; they
may not work at all.

Receiving Word documents is bad for you because they can carry viruses
(see [Macro virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_virus_(computing))). Sending
Word documents is bad for you because a Word document normally
includes hidden information about the author, enabling those in the know
to pry into the author's activities (maybe yours). Text that you think you
deleted may still be embarrassingly present. See [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3154479.stm) for more info.

But above all, sending people Word documents puts pressure on them to
use Microsoft software and helps to deny them any other choice. In effect,
you become a buttress of the Microsoft monopoly. This pressure is a major
obstacle to the broader adoption of free software.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,

William DeMeo
